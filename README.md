# Grails Twitter Bootstrap

A basic Grails application that has been updated with all the plugins, files, and resources to include the Twitter Bootstrap look-and-feel.

Basically, here is what I did to create this:
1. grails create-app
2. Add twitter-bootstrap and fields plugins
3. Copy scaffolding files from the example application
4. Clean up some references to missing resources, and update the index.gsp page to look more like the default grails index.gsp

**Resources:**
Twitter-Bootstrap plugin: 
http://grails.org/plugin/twitter-bootstrap

Fields plugin:

**Background**

I found myself doing this same process a couple of times so I decided to just do it one time and put it on GitHub so I would not have to do it over and over again. If I help anyone else in the process, that is great!
