# Grails Twitter Bootstrap

A basic Grails application that has been updated with the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) look-and-feel.

Basically, here is what I did to create this:

1. grails create-app
2. Download the bootstrap files and add them to the project
3. Update the scaffolding templates at a very basic level

**Background**

I found myself doing this same process a couple of times so I decided to just do it one time and put it on GitHub so I would not have to do it over and over again. If I help anyone else in the process, that is great!

**Version**

This is running on Grails 2.4.3. For Grails 2.1.0, which was done in a slightly different way, check out the corresponding branch.
